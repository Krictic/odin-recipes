        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 sticks of fresh lemongrass </li>
            <li>1 bunch of fresh coriander , (30g) </li>
            <li>5cm piece of fresh ginger</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>½ x small bottle of low-salt dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 large salmon fillet , (about 1kg), ask your fishmonger, scaled and pin-boned, from sustainable sources.</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons runny honey</li>
            <li>2 red chillies </li>
            <li>4 spring onions</li>
            <li>2 limes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bash up your lemongrass. Pick the coriander leaves and finely slice the stalks. Peel and finely grate the ginger and garlic.</li>
            <li>Mix the lemongrass, coriander stalks, ginger and garlic with the soy sauce, then rub all over the salmon fillet. Leave it to marinate for an hour or so, either in a plastic bag or on a tray covered with clingfilm.</li>
            <li>Preheat your grill to its highest setting. When you’re ready to cook the salmon, remove it from the marinade, brush with the honey and grill for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Deseed the chillies and finely slice with the spring onions.</li>
            <li>Fork up the cooked salmon a little so everyone can see the lovely, dark, sticky outside and the juicy, pink fish underneath.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the chillies and spring onions over the salmon with the reserved coriander leaves. Squeeze over the lime.</li>
        </ol>
